# Headless Chrome vs Barracuda BOT Protection

# DEMO ONLY

## Requirements: Python 

For demo purposes of our sophisticated bot protection.

Bot Protection is no longer about Hydra anymore. 
Basic bot protection is not enough.
We have advanced bot protection, and it's not so easy to demonstrate this without using the same underlying frameworks that a modern bot-herder commercial offering would use to build their own tools that they sell to the script kiddies.

The original "next-gen" bots were entities like Selenium and PhantomJS.

But here we are in 2021 ( 2022 now) and now those are eclipsed with headless chrome.

So, in a nutshell: These Python scripts execute headless chrome bot attacks against my known vulnerable web workload.
